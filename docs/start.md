Please review the following links in order to understand how to contribute code to ReportHub repositories

### GitHub Fork & Pull Approach

- [Fork & Pull Approach](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962)
- [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)


# Vagrant Local Server

With Dropbox folders unselected for sync, run the following commands to setup the local development environment.

Steps
  
1. on the cmd line, navigate to ``ReportHub/ngm`` folder in Dropbox

		$ cd ~/Dropbox/ReportHub/ngm/ReportHub/ngm
		
2. in ``@ReportHub/ngm`` folder fetch ``ngm-reportShell`` repo 

		$ git clone https://github.com/pfitzpaddy/ngm-reportShell.git
		
3. cd into ``ngm-reportShell``


		$ cd ngm-reportShell
		
4. Update the GitHub repository locations to your forked version of the code

		# UPDATE TO YOUR FORKED REPO!
		sudo git clone https://github.com/<your.fork>/ngm-reportHub.git

5. Run [Vagrant Up](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/cli/up.html) command

		$ vagrant up
		
	> NOTE: This will take some time to fetch the Ubuntu Lts 14.04 VirtualBox image as well as install server software to establish a replica local server environemnt

5. During install, review VirtualBox configurations in 
	- ``ngm-reportShell/Vagrantfile``
	- ``ngm-reportShell/ngm-reporthub.shell.build.sh``


# Running ReportHub

Once the VirtualBox is completed installation, you can access the configured ReportHub Ubuntu LTS 14.0.4 Virtual Machine via the ``vagrant ssh`` command

Steps

1. Within the ``ngm-reportShell`` folder, ssh into machine

		$ vagrant ssh
		
2. Within the server, navigate to the ``ngm-reportEngine`` repository

		$ cd /home/ubuntu/nginx/www/ngm-reportEngine
		
3. Start the Sails RestAPI application

		$ sudo sails lift

4. Navigate to [http://192.168.33.16](http://192.168.33.16) and ReportHub is running!
